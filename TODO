- Independent Component Analysis rather than PCA

  Probably need to run this under R.

- In the results page, should show the map defined by the first few
  eigenvectors, and also show where you would move on the map if you changed
  your answer to any of the given questions; or, what questions you'd have
  to answer differently to get to a particular point.

- Offer a PDF file of the questions, and an Excel spreadsheet (or a web
  application?) which allows the results to be computed manually.

- Election manifestos: linked from http://www.howtovote.co.uk/

- Offer to record a link to some web page in the session, and then to look for
  others who've also done so and are similar / distinct in views to you.

- Consider writing it up as a Kuro5hin article?

- Put all this stuff into anonymous CVS.

- Marginal and total distributions on the axes.

- Fix the eigenvector display to account for the constant of proportionality
  between normal/converse.

- Display the numerical contribution to each eigenvector of each answer.

- Mark's suggestion of displaying each respondent's `most surprising answers'.

  Could do this by figuring out the probability density for each question as
  predicted by answers to all the others, then picking ones which are less
  probable than some threshold.

- Center-right politicians among the `celebrities'?

  (One of Mark's friends complained that the quiz would make it difficult to
  take up a center-right `Ken Clarke' position. Is this true?)

- Tom Steinberg suggested soliciting information about the social class, age
  gender etc. of respondents, and attempting to weight the data to a UK mean.

New questions:

 - Something about the amount of new legislation:
 
   Much new legislation is passed for public-relations reasons, rather than to
   address real problems.

   or, Our politicians pass too many new laws.

   or, In a rapidly changing world, it is necessary to pass many new laws, even
   if people and businesses sometimes find it hard to keep up.
