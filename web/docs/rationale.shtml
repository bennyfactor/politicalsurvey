<h1>Political Survey: Rationale</h1>

<!--#include virtual="/menu.shtml" -->

<p>politicalcompass.org is a web site which asks a number of opinion questions
of its visitors, and then places them in a two-dimensional space which is
supposed to characterise their political views. Unfortunately,
politicalcompass.org has a poor reputation; in particular, there is a suspicion
that its questions are designed to make respondents lean towards an
economically right-wing, socially liberal ("right libertarian") position, and
the two axes of variation on which results are plotted are opaque in their
derivation and may not be tremendously relevant.</p>

<p>These suspicions are compounded by the problem that politicalcompass.org's
methods are not open and, therefore, it is not possible to determine whether
their selection of questions carries a bias which its operators are using to
further their own ends.</p>

<p>The purpose of this site is to do a survey of this type properly and openly,
so that the methods and data in use are open to inspection.</p>

<h2>More detail</h2>

<p>The proper way to do this is to collect a bunch of questions and a bunch of
answers to them, then take the space defined by all the answers to the
questions, and construct a spanning basis for it. The natural way to do this is
with principal components analysis, though as a non-statistician I can't
comment on whether this is actually the best approach. We should then be able
to discover -- in terms defined by the answers to the questions set -- the
significant axes of variation in the data.</p>

<p>This means that <em>all the results we get are defined by the data</em>: we
do not measure anyone's views according to criteria we set out, but according
to endogenous criteria. The only points at which our judgment enters the method
are</p>

<ul>
<li>when choosing questions (or, rather propositions); and</li>
<li>when we give context to the results.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first of those shouldn't matter, if the questions are reasonably
unbiased and cover a wide enough range of subject materials. The second doesn't
matter, since it's just a presentational issue.</p>

<p>I'll write a bit more about this later, but for now, here are
<a href="statsnotes.pdf">some notes about the process</a>.</p>

<h2>Openness</h2>

<p>Openness requires that the source code for the software which runs the site,
and the data from which the principal axes were computed, be available.
You can get both from <a href="internals.shtml">the internals page</a>.</p>
