<h1>Political Survey: Privacy Statement</h1>

<!--#include virtual="menu.shtml" -->

<p>When you complete the survey, the site records the following information:</p>

<ul>
<li>a randomly-generated ID number which is used to identify your survey
results;</li>
<li>your answers to the survey, including the country of origin you state;</li>
<li>the IP address from which you visit these web pages;</li>
<li>the time and date when you completed the survey.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our web logs also record any referring page information which your browser
sends. This information is retained for about a month, is not used in the
analysis, and will not be made publicly available.</p>

<p>Because this survey is designed to be open, we will give out to others
enough data for them to verify the results. This will be a subset of the
above information, as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <em>different</em> randomly-generated ID number, which is not connected to
the one you were assigned when you complete the survey;</li>
<li>your answers to the survey, including the country of origin you state.</li>
</ul>

<p>Time, date and IP address information will not be given out.</p>

<p>This data and the code used to process it is available from
<a href="internals.shtml">the internals page</a>.</p>

<p>This site does not use cookies and does not attempt to track repeat
visitors.</p>

<h2>Linking to this site</h2>

<p>You may want to display your results from the survey on your web page or
web log. If you want to display the scatter plot of your position, you can do
so either by linking to it directly, or by copying it to your own server and
linking it from there. Either is fine by us, but note that <em>if you link to
the image on our server, you are giving away enough information for others to
see your detailed response page</em>, because the address of the results graph
contains your "survey ID", which can be used to find your results page. If you
do not wish to allow others to see your detailed results, you should copy the
image rather than linking it.</p>
