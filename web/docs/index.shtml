<h1>Political Survey</h1>

<!--#include virtual="menu.shtml" -->

<p>This is an attempt to build an open and unbiased way to measure peoples'
political outlooks. There's some information on the
<a href="rationale.shtml">rationale</a> behind the survey, which might be
of interest.</p>

<p>Alternatively, just <a href="scripts/survey">take the survey</a>.</p>

<h2>News</h2>

<ul>
<li>26 November, 2003:</br>
I have set up <a href="internals.shtml">a page</a> from which the code and
data from the survey can be downloaded.</li>
<li>18 November, 2003:<br>
Corrected a small bug in the results script. Some results may change slightly.
Thanks to Darius Bacon for identifying this problem.</li>
<li>10 November, 2003:<br>
<a href="http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~lambert/cgi-bin/blog/">Tim Lambert</a> is
operating 
<a href="http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~lambert/cgi-bin/blog/surveys/polsurvey.html">a
web page</a> on which you can record the results you get from this survey.</li>
<li>9 November, 2003:<br>
Thanks go to Richard Pond for correcting me on another error in the
<a href="/scripts/celebrity?celebid=1449698736">supposed answers for Tony
Benn</a> (regarding his views on Kosovo).</li>
<li>8 November, 2003:<br>
Fixed some errors in the
<a href="/scripts/celebrity?celebid=1449698736">supposed answers for Tony
Benn</a>, whose position on the scatter plot changes significantly. Apologies
for this mistake.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Progress</h2>

<p>We now have over three hundred and fifty results from the survey, and the
axes on which we intend to plot answers are quite well defined. You can now
do the survey and see your results, or return to the address you were given
when you previously completed the survey, to find out where you lie.</p>

<p>You can read some more information about progress up to this point in these
postings from <a href="http://ex-parrot.com/~chris/wwwitter/">my web log</a>:
