<h1>Political Survey: Internals</h1>

<!--#include virtual="menu.shtml" -->

<p>For openness, it's important that all the internals of the site are
available to public view. At the most basic level this means that the code and
data used must be made available (subject to the restrictions described in the
<a href="privacy.shtml">privacy statement</a>). This, with a little luck,
should be enough for anyone else to get their own version of the site up and
running, and to check our own results. The data and programs may be of interest
in their own right, too.</p>

<h2>Code</h2>

<p>The code which runs this site is written in
<a href="http://www.cpan.org/">perl</a>, with a little bit of C for speed. You
need a modern version of perl (5.6.x), and various modules:</p>

<ul>
<li>CGI</li>
<li>CGI::Carp</li>
<li>CGI::Fast</li>
<li>DBD::SQLite</li>
<li>DBI</li>
<li>Data::Dumper</li>
<li>Error</li>
<li>GD</li>
<li>HTML::Entities</li>
<li>IO::File</li>
<li>IO::Pipe</li>
<li>Inline</li>
<li>Math::MatrixReal</li>
<li>POSIX</li>
<li>Text::CSV</li>
</ul>

<p>Many of these may already be included in your distribution. You will also
need a C compiler. Although there's probably not much in there which is
UNIX-specific, I have made no effort to make the code very portable; you are
welcome to try to get it running on any other system, but you will save yourself
work if you use Linux.</p>

<p>The database used by the site is <a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a>;
the distribution for the DBD::SQLite module contains a complete copy of the
(public domain) SQLite libraries, but you may want to get the author's original
distribution too, as it contains the useful sqlite command-line monitor
program.</p>

<p>You can get a copy of the code as a compressed tar file:
<a href="internals/politicalsurvey-code.tar.gz">politicalsurvey.tar.gz</a>.</p>

<p>As for documentation, you're rather on your own, though the code is
extensively commented. Please <a href="mailto:chris@politics.beasts.org">email
me</a> with any questions.</p>

<p>The code is available under the
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html">GNU General Public Licence,
version 2</a>, or, at your option, any later version.</p>

<h2>Data</h2>

<p>As described in the <a href="rationale.shtml">rationale</a>, the results
produced by this site are based on axes derived from the data itself. In order
for the software to produce any results, it needs to be bootstrapped with a
whole lot of data from surveys. The data from this site are available in the
form of a bzip2-compressed dump of the SQL database, cleaned of
privacy-sensitive information as described in the
<a href="privacy.shtml">privacy statement</a>.</p>

<p>You can download the data as
<a href="internals/dump.sql.bz2">dump.sql.bz2</a> (quite a large file). Note
that this dump does not contain the IP-address-to-country mapping which is used
to guess respondents' countries of origin from their client IP addresses; that
can be <a href="http://ip-to-country.directi.com/">obtained separately</a>.</p>
